\chapter{Documentation tools}
\section{What is available?}
The current documentation tool market provides the following solutions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \href{https://github.com/dotnet/docfx}{DocFX}
    \item \href{https://www.doxygen.nl/}{Doxygen}
    \item \href{https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/SourceBrowser}{Source Browser}
    \item \href{https://github.com/lijunle/Vsxmd}{Vsxmd}
    \item \href{https://github.com/discosultan/vsdoc-2-md}{vsdoc-2-md}
\end{enumerate}

What follows are evaluations of each tool. This helped get a better understanding of the current offering and gain prospect on features and improvements that the custom tool can take advantage of.

\subsection{DocFX}

\textit{DocFX} is an open-source documentation generation tool developed by Microsoft that not only supports .NET languages C\#, F\#, and Visual Basic, but also Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and REST. Additionally, it can use raw Markdown files as input.

However, the \textit{DocFX} only outputs static \ref{itm:html} pages. The only available customizability is via templates for said static pages.

The tool is capable and is the go-to solution for \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} projects, but it doesn't solve the task of outputting Markdown files.

\subsection{Doxygen}

\textit{Doxygen} is the industry-standard documentation generating tool originally made for C++ source code documentation. Nevertheless, it has over time added support for many popular programming languages such as C, C\#, Java, Python, and many more.

The tool provides an extensive set of supported output formats:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Static \ref{itm:html}
    \item \LaTeX\footnote{Document preparation system}
    \item Man pages\footnote{User manual type that is part of Unix operating systems \cite{credocs_limited_latex_2022}}
    \item \ref{itm:rtf}
    \item \ref{itm:xml}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Source Browser}

\textit{Source Browser} is a tool that generates a website for browsing source code and its documentation. The tool is used by Microsoft, for example, to allow developers to browse the source code of \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel}.

The generated output is not fully static and has to be hosted on an \ref{gloss:aspnetcore} website to support searching.

\subsection{Vsxmd} \label{ssec:vsxmd}

\textit{Vsxmd} generates a single Markdown file for all types in a given assembly. Moreover, the tool has no \ref{itm:ui} and works as a \ref{gloss:nuget} package, that is added to the project designated for documentation generation. Thus, configuring this tool is done via \ref{gloss:dotnetlabel} project settings.

It is not possible to navigate the documentation, as no links are generated.

\subsection{Vsdoc-2-md}

\textit{Vsdoc-2-md} is an entirely unusable tool, as it is purely web-based and generates documentation from the provided \ref{itm:xml} documentation source file. The tool is limited to processing only one file at a time.

Just like \textit{\nameref{ssec:vsxmd}}, no links are generated; thus, it is not possible to navigate the documentation.

\section{What do users want?}
Surveying of potential users of the tool is necessary to ensure that the developed product is utilized by more than its developer.
Thus, creating the questionnaire was the first step to success. Its purpose was to figure out the following key points:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Whether users already use documentation generation tools, and if so, which ones
    \item What do users feel is missing from the tools they use
    \item What do users believe should be carried over to the new tool from the ones they use
    \item Whether users would integrate such tools into their \ref{gloss:cicd} pipelines
    \item What output formats do users want
    \item What operating systems do users want the tool to work on
    \item Would users find a \ref{itm:gui} beneficial for such a tool
    \item Would users appreciate the tool being extensible via plugins
\end{itemize}
