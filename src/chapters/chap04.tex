\chapter{M1: Proof of concept}

Before investing an unknown amunt of time, it is best to verify whether the desired result is achievable. Developing a proof of concept application will give insight into the complexity of the task and how to tackle it.

The most crucial goal of this milestone is to find an optimal project structure. Neglecting this important aspect will introduce code quality degredation as the project grows.
