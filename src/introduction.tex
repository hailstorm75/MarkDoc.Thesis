The motivation for creating a custom tool for generating documentation from .NET libraries is a personal need to provide easy access to code documentation. Since most open source projects are hosted either on GitHub.com\footnote{A Microsoft-owned Git hosting platform} or GitLab.com\footnote{An independent Git hosting platform}, it makes sense to utilize said platforms for hosting source code documentation for consistency.

When attempting to find tools that generate documentation, none had the desired extensibility and were limited to only creating static HTML pages. Since Git hosting platforms predominantly\footnote{GitLab also supports RDoc, AsciiDoc, and Org} utilize Markdown for displaying formatted text.

And so, the idea to develop a custom tool that would create Markdown documentation from .NET libraries for Git platforms came to fruition. However, focusing only on one output format would be a waste of time and effort, as few to none would actually need such a tool. Thus, the result of development should be a generic tool that allows anyone to modify it to output to any desirable format.

Accomplishing this task will require analysing the currently available tools, getting user feedback, planning out the project structure, and finally developing the tool itself.
